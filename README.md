TogetherMap
===========

A platform for place-based conversations - documentation is in the form of question and answer.

* What does TM mean?

    TM is shorthand for TogetherMap.

* What is the purpose of TM?

  Generally, our mission is to provide an app for people to talk about what's happening in their communities.  Along the way we realized we were building a pretty useful multi-user environment for place collecting, map making, and data collection, so   we're going to try out a few things and see what works.  Target use cases include:

  * Loading shapefile data of recent condo developments in San Francisco and talking about them.
  * Building a list of your favorite nearby places for friends that are visiting from out of town.
  * Adding pictures to places to photo blog your travels.
  * Collecting data about places using web forms.
    
* I see places and posts mentioned a lot - what are those?

    * Places are shapes on the map.  They can be markers, lines, or free-form shapes.
    * Posts are topics about that place.  Posts are the same thing that they are in web message boards like Reddit.  We're building place-based discussions with-reddit like functionality.
    * Also, comments are responses to posts
    
    Really the use of places, posts, and comments is defined by your convention.  Some users don't use comments at all.  Some don't even use posts and just TM to collection places and make maps.  It's really up to you to define a convention within a colleciton.
    
* I hear the word collection mentioned a lot - what's that?

    Collections are a way to organize your places into groups which have a common theme.  A number of things are tied to collections including permissions, theming of how places appear both in the sidebar and on the map, etc.  Collections are similar to a "board" in Pinterest or a "layer" in GIS.  The key feature of TM is to store many collections in the same system and to be able to search across collections - for instance, to find all the places near where you, no matter the collection they are a part of.  Nonetheless, a great many use cases involve collecting place data within a single collection, and we will make sure to provide access to that functionality in the simplest way possible without complicating things with the greater mission of TM.
    
* So, what's the best way to get started?

    My favorite use case is to collect places I want to remember - e.g. a set of coffee shops I might want to go to.  So let's assume you and a few friends want to build a collection of the best coffee shops for working in San Francisco.
    
    * First move the map to San Francisco or to whever you are using the "location arrow" in the upper left corner of the map.  It takes a second (and you might have to accept permissions) but this moves the map to your location just like in Google Maps.
    * Next make a new collection by clicking "Go" and "New".  This takes you to the new collection.
    * Next click "Go" and then "Search".  By default TM searches the place database provided by Factual, Inc. in order to get a great starter set of "places" in the world.  The mission of TM is to collect places that aren't in Factual, but Factual has a list of all the coffee shops, restaurants, parks, dentists, and so forth for getting started (over 65 million places worldwide).  Put "coffee" into the search box and TM begins to search automatically.

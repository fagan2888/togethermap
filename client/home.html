                    The world is a changing place.  New coffee shops open all the
                    time, music venues close, and new condos rise from empty lots.
                    TogetherMap is an app that allows you to browse and discuss your
                    changing neighborhood.

                    <br><br>

                    Make a map of your favorite parks in
                    San Francisco, or a map of metro areas worldwide. Invite a few
                    friends and have a private conversation or leave a collection
                    public and see what happens when you invite the whole world.
